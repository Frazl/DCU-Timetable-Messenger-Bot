## Update

As of January 2019, DCU has updated their timetabling systems to now be mobile friendly and so this bot is less required and also broken due to the new layout of the timetable not being compataible with the current scraper.

## Description 

A simple facebook messenger bot for scraping the DCU timetable and returning requested.

This program was made using **Python 3.6.4**
